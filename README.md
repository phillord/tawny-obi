# tawny-obi

A tawny-owl import for the OBI ontology. 

## Introduction

Tawny-OBI provides an import of the
[OBI ontology](http://www.jbiomedsem.com/content/1/S1/S7). Tawny-owl is a
library which is designed to allow ontology development in a fully
programmatic environment, using the clojure language which is supported by
existing IDEs. OBI is an Ontology for Biomedical Investigation, which
describes the experimental context surrounding a biomedical experiment.

This library imports OBI from an included OWL file into a Clojure namespace,
which can then be developed against directly using the tawny-owl library. 

Currently, this is not intended as production code; I am using it as a test
case for the tawny-owl environment.
